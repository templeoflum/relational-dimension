# Cross-Experiment Findings

**Purpose:** Track discoveries, disproven claims, and open questions across all experiments.

**Status:** Empty (experiments not yet executed)

---

## Format

Findings are numbered F1, F2, F3, etc. Each includes:
- **Source experiment**
- **Type** (Discovery, Falsification, Limitation, Question)
- **Description**
- **Implications**

## Findings

### From Experiment 01: Topology vs Correlation Dimension

*No findings yet - experiment not executed.*

---

## Disproven Claims

*To be populated when predictions fail.*

---

## Open Questions

### Q1: Is the substrate fundamentally 2D?
- **Status:** Unresolved
- **Evidence for:** Holographic principle, QG convergence on d→2
- **Evidence against:** Could be d-1 for any d, not specifically 2
- **Next steps:** Test whether compression always reduces by 1 dimension

### Q2: What physical quantity does recursion depth correspond to?
- **Status:** Unresolved  
- **Candidates:** Energy scale, time evolution, coarse-graining steps
- **Next steps:** Test whether different parameterizations give same results

### Q3: Does quantum correlation compression preserve Lorentz invariance?
- **Status:** Unresolved
- **Concern:** CST's key achievement is discrete + Lorentz invariant. Can we maintain this?
- **Next steps:** Test correlation measures in different reference frames

## Cross-Cutting Themes

*To be identified after multiple experiments complete.*

---

## Novel Contributions Assessment

*Reserved for meta-analysis phase after all experiments.*
